          Hi, I'm Thilo. I have been building web applications for a living for almost two decades. I launched
          several successful companies as technical co-founder, among them <a href="https://www.legitscript.com">LegitScript</a>, where I served as 
          Chief Technology Officer until 2016, and <a href="https://www.travelmobile.biz">Travel Mobile</a>, where I run all tech as DevOpsCodeMonkey. 
          In 2016, I launched my own consultancy company, <a href="http://sourceworks.io">SourceWorks</a>.

          My entire career has been about startups. I'm always interested in new ideas about how to
          use the Internet for world domination or building a better mousetrap. If you have one and could use some
          tech advice, I'd love to hear from you.

          Originally from Germany, I spent 10 years in the United States before settling in Dublin, Ireland, where I live with my wife and daughter.
